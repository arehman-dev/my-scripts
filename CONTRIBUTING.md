#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on error

# Function names use snake_case
backup_files() {
    local source_dir="$1"
    local backup_dir="$2"
    
    # Validate inputs
    if [[ ! -d "$source_dir" ]]; then
        echo "Error: Source directory does not exist" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Create backup
    cp -r "$source_dir" "$backup_dir"
    echo "Backup completed successfully"
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the area of a rectangle
 * @param {number} width - The width of the rectangle
 * @param {number} height - The height of the rectangle
 * @returns {number} The area of the rectangle
 */
function calculateArea(width, height) {
    if (width <= 0 || height <= 0) {
        throw new Error('Width and height must be positive numbers');
    }
    
    return width * height;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> list:
    """
    Calculate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of terms to generate
        
    Returns:
        list: Fibonacci sequence as a list
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of terms cannot be negative")
    
    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    
    return fib_sequence
```
