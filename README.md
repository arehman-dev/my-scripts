# 🚀 My Scripts Collection

A well-organized collection of scripts, projects, and learning materials across multiple programming languages. This repository serves as my personal development workspace with a structured approach to code organization.

## 📊 Repository Overview

- **Languages**: Shell, JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Python, C++ 
- **Total Files**: 100+ scripts and projects
- **Organization**: Language-specific directories with consistent naming conventions
- **Purpose**: Personal scripts storage and learning repository

## 🎯 Naming Convention

This repository follows a strict naming convention for better organization:

### Prefixes
- `s01-` - Sequential scripts
- `c01-` - Course chapters/lessons  
- `p01-` - Projects
- `d01-` - Daily practice tasks

### Rules
- **Lowercase only** with hyphen separation
- **Two-digit padding** for natural sorting
- **ASCII characters** for Linux compatibility
- **Clear file extensions** (`.sh`, `.py`, `.js`, etc.)

For complete details, see [`naming_convention.md`](./naming_convention.md).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Bash/Shell environment
- Node.js (for JavaScript projects)
- Python 3.x (for Python scripts)
- GCC/G++ (for C++ programs)

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arehman-dev/my-scripts.git
   cd my-scripts
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
   ```

3. Run scripts from their respective directories:
   ```bash
   # Example: Run a bash script
   ./a.bash/script-name.sh
   
   # Example: Run a Python script
   python3 a.py/script-name.py
   ```
